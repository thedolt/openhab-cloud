    <h3>Hello <%= email %>!</h3>
    <p>
    <h3>You've been invited to use openHAB Cloud service, a cloud companion for your awesome openHAB!</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>Before you start!</h3>
    <p>
        Before you start enjoing your experience with openHAB Cloud you should know several important things on what
        openHAB Cloud is and how it works.
    </p>
    <li>openHAB Cloud is a cloud service, with all it's pros and cons. You can't use such a service without passing any
    data through it at all. But what we do is minimizing amount of that data down to possible limit just to make it
    work at all.</li>
    <li>Your openHAB will maintain a continuous HTTPS connection to openHAB Cloud. This connection is established when
    you start openHAB and openHAB Cloud bundle loads and it only closes when you shut down your openHAB. This connection
    is initiated from your openHAB, not from openHAB Cloud cloud.</li>
    <li>HTTPS connection to openHAB Cloud is established using commercial SSL certificate on openHAB Cloud side.
    Authentication is performed on UUID of your openHAB install and autogenerated secret. Both UUID and secret
    are generated by openHAB. You pass them to openHAB Cloud yourself when registering an account.</li>
    <li>When you connect remotely through openHAB Cloud back to your openHAB what really happens is that you talk
    to openHAB Cloud with HTTPS, secured with the same commercial SSL certificate.</li>
    <li>When you connect remotely you are authenticated by openHAB Cloud, not by your openHAB. This is done this way
    for several reasons. The main reason is to protect your openHAB from possible DoS attacks and malicious
    activity. If the request is not authorized, it will not even be sent to your openHAB.</li>
    <li>If the request is successfully authorized it will be forwarded back to your openHAB, then sent locally
    as a legal HTTP request to http://localhost:8080/ and the response will then be securely forwarded to
    you.</li>
    <p>
    <h3>You need to complete the following steps to start using openHAB Cloud:</h3>
    <li>Make sure you now use Java 1.7. Unfortunately openHAB Cloud bundle depends on it, not on 1.6.</li>
    <li><a href="https://bintray.com/artifact/download/openhab/mvn/org/openhab/io/org.openhab.io.myopenhab/1.7.0/org.openhab.io.myopenhab-1.7.0.jar">Download openHAB Cloud IO bundle</a>
     and put it into <code>addons</code> folder of your openHAB installation.</li>
    <li>Switch off authentication for local requests, because openHAB Cloud bundle sends requests to http://localhost:8080/</li>
    <li>Go to <code>webapps/static</code> directory in your openHAB folder and look up 2 files - <code>uuid</code> and
    <code>secret</code>. You will need their contents for the next step!</li>
    <li>Proceed to <a href="https://myopenhab.org/login?invitationCode=<%=invitationCode%>">openHAB Cloud</a> and register a new account.
    Just for the record, your invitation code is <%= invitationCode %></li>
    <li>Your openHAB will connect to openHAB Cloud service automatically now and become online!</li>
    <li>Configure remote URL of openHAB in openHAB Android or iOS app settings as https://myopenhab.org</li>
    <li>Configure username/password as used at openHAB Cloud registration in HABDroid settings</li>
    <li>Yes, https://myopenhab.org/openhab.app?sitemap=&lt;your sitemap name&gt; should work too!</li>
    <li>Have fun! Now you can remove any holes in your home router, disable VPN, or whatever you used to connect to
    your openHAB remotely!</li>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>Known limitations</h3>
    <li>Because of specifics of stack of technologies we used to create openHAB Cloud, transfer of binary data is not yet
    as efficient as it should be, so when loading icons for the first time on Android and iOS apps remotely, the process
    can seem a little bit slow, sometimes. But only for the first time and only sometimes :-)</li>
    <li>openHAB Cloud doesn't currently support streaming HTTP, so mjpeg and video will not work this time, but we are
    working hard to add this feature!</li>
    </p>
    <h3>Best regards,
    openHAB Cloud team!
